**Update claude.md with Today's Engineering Learnings**

Please help me document the last 24-48 hours' engineering learnings by updating the `claude.md` file in the root of this project.

Review my chat threads/conversations, git commits, file changes, and work from the last 24-48 hours and add a new learning entry (if not already documented previously) to the appropriate section of `claude.md`.

**Instructions:**

1. Read the existing `claude.md` file to understand the current structure and format
2. Add today's learnings in a way that's most useful for an AI coding agent to reference in future sessions
3. Focus on learnings that would help the agent understand:
   - Architectural decisions I made and why
   - Patterns or approaches specific to this codebase
   - Mistakes I made and how I fixed them (so they're not repeated)
   - Project-specific conventions or preferences I've established
   - Technical challenges I solved and the solution approach
   - Tools or libraries I've integrated and how they work in this context

**Format the entry as:**
- Date: [Today's date]
- Brief context of what I was working on
- 2-4 key learnings written clearly and concisely
- Any relevant code patterns or examples (if applicable)

Write in a style that makes it easy for an AI agent to quickly parse and apply these learnings when working on future tasks in this codebase.

Keep entries concise but actionable - these learnings should compound over time to make the AI agent more effective at helping me build PlayBookings.

This approach lets us build institutional knowledge directly into the project so Cursor/Claude can reference, making the AI progressively better at understanding this specific codebase and decisions.
