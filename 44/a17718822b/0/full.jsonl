Yes — you can delete `/.swc` and everything in it.

- **Nothing in your codebase uses it**  
  No imports, configs, or scripts reference `.swc`. The only “swc” references are npm packages under `node_modules` (e.g. `@next/swc-darwin-arm64`, `@swc/helpers`), which are separate and stay in `node_modules`.

- **What `/.swc` is**  
  It’s a **cache** used by the SWC toolchain (e.g. by Next.js). The contents you have (e.g. `.swc/plugins/v7_macos_aarch64_17.0.0`, `macos_aarch64_23.0.0`) are platform/version plugin caches. They are regenerated when you run `next build` or similar.

- **Config**  
  `next.config.ts` and `jest.config.ts` don’t point at `.swc`; the folder is created automatically by the tooling.

So: **safe to delete**. After deletion, the next build may recreate `.swc` if the toolchain needs it. To keep it out of git, add this to `.gitignore`:
[Tool call] StrReplace
  path: /Users/jensenmiers/Aug2025PlayBookingsWork/PlayBookings/.gitignore
  old_string: # next.js
/.next/
/out/
  new_string: # next.js
/.next/
/out/
/.swc

assistant:
Added `/.swc` to `.gitignore` so it won’t be committed if it’s recreated.

To remove it now:

```bash
rm -rf .swc
```

what about this .skill-meta.json file? is that used to call the frontend design tool or a different version of that file i deleted that did exist o the last commit?

Here’s what’s going on:

**1. Does `.skill-meta.json` call the frontend design tool?**  
**No.** The frontend design skill is used when the agent follows **SKILL.md** (its description and when to use it). `.skill-meta.json` is only **metadata** (e.g. `source: "registry"`, `name`, `installedAt`, `updatedAt`) for install/registry tooling. It doesn’t control whether or how the skill is invoked.

**2. Is it a different version of something you deleted?**  
**No.** In the last commit that touched these paths (`44403b2` – “add frontend, supabase, vervel, and react skills”), both of these were **added** in the same commit:

- `.cursor/skills/frontend-design/.skill-meta.json`
- `.github/skills/frontend-design/.skill-meta.json`

So there were two copies from the start; neither is a replacement for a deleted file. They’re the same metadata in two places (timestamps differ by a few ms).

**Summary**

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|--------|
| **`.cursor/skills/frontend-design/`** | What Cursor actually uses (SKILL.md + .skill-meta.json). This is the one that matters for the agent. |
| **`.github/skills/frontend-design/`** | Likely for sharing/CI or another tool (e.g. GitHub Copilot) that reads from `.github/skills`. |

You can delete **`.github/skills/frontend-design/.skill-meta.json`** (or the whole `.github/skills/frontend-design/` folder) without affecting Cursor’s use of the frontend design skill, as long as you keep **`.cursor/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md`** (and optionally `.cursor/skills/frontend-design/.skill-meta.json`). The file that “calls” the tool is **SKILL.md**, not `.skill-meta.json`.
